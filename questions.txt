-> Yes IT WAS OYUR FUCKING fault, pay attention, stop autopilotion

Were you standing in an uncomfortable position that made a gank easy?

Do you have a scaling/farming jungle like shyyvanna ok a jungler that generally doesn't before hitting a certain level like nocture?
-> Yes

Did you get dove?
-> Yes

Did you ping for help before getting dove and your jungler ignored it?
-> Yes

Did your jungler make a cross map play or get an objective?
